# FAQ
### Q: I found a bug/I have a feature request!
A: It's still a WIP so bugs are to be expected, submit them under the `issues`tab and i _will_ fix them.

### Q: I have a feature request will you add it? 
A: Mostlikely not, this will be a straight port of the Megadrive/Genisis release with some enhancements form Origins (like player sprites)
